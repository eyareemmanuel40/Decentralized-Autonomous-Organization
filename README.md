# Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO)

A comprehensive DAO framework enabling decentralized governance, transparent decision-making, and automated execution of community-approved proposals.

## Overview

This DAO platform provides a complete suite of smart contracts for creating and managing decentralized organizations. It features flexible membership management, robust proposal systems, secure treasury management, and automated execution of approved decisions.

## Core Components

### Membership Contract
- Role-based access control system
- Token-based membership management
- Reputation scoring mechanism
- Member activity tracking
- Delegation system
- Membership verification
- Dynamic permission management

### Proposal Contract
- Proposal creation and management
- Multiple voting mechanisms
    - Token-weighted voting
    - Quadratic voting
    - Time-weighted voting
- Vote delegation system
- Proposal lifecycle management
- Discussion and amendment system
- Voting power calculation

### Treasury Contract
- Multi-token treasury management
- Expenditure tracking
- Budget allocation system
- Investment management
- Financial reporting
- Vesting schedules
- Emergency fund management

### Execution Contract
- Proposal execution automation
- Time-lock mechanisms
- Multi-signature requirements
- Execution verification
- Fallback procedures
- Transaction batching
- Execution reporting

## Technical Requirements

- Ethereum-compatible blockchain
- Solidity ^0.8.0
- Node.js â‰¥16.0.0
- Hardhat development framework
- Web3.js or ethers.js
- IPFS for proposal storage
- OpenZeppelin contracts

## Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-username/dao-platform.git

# Install dependencies
cd dao-platform
npm install

# Compile contracts
npx hardhat compile

# Run tests
npx hardhat test
```

## Usage Guide

### Creating a New DAO

```solidity
function createDAO(
    string memory _name,
    address[] memory _initialMembers,
    uint256 _votingPeriod,
    uint256 _quorum
) external returns (address);
```

### Submitting Proposals

```solidity
function createProposal(
    string memory _title,
    string memory _description,
    address[] memory _targets,
    uint256[] memory _values,
    bytes[] memory _calldatas
) external returns (uint256);
```

### Voting System

```solidity
function castVote(
    uint256 _proposalId,
    bool _support
) external;

function delegateVote(
    address _delegatee
) external;
```

## Governance Parameters

- Minimum Voting Period: 72 hours
- Maximum Voting Period: 2 weeks
- Quorum Requirement: 20% of voting power
- Proposal Threshold: 1% of total supply
- Execution Delay: 24 hours
- Emergency Timelock: 48 hours

## Security Features

- Time-locked execution
- Multi-signature requirements
- Emergency pause mechanism
- Access control system
- Proposal validation
- Vote verification
- Treasury protection

## Member Rights

1. Proposal Creation
    - Submit new proposals
    - Comment on existing proposals
    - Suggest amendments

2. Voting Rights
    - Cast votes on proposals
    - Delegate voting power
    - View voting history

3. Treasury Management
    - View treasury status
    - Propose fund allocations
    - Monitor expenditures

## Implementation Guide

### Setting Up Membership

1. Define membership criteria
2. Configure voting power calculation
3. Set up role permissions
4. Initialize member registry

### Configuring Voting

1. Choose voting mechanism
2. Set voting parameters
3. Configure vote counting
4. Implement vote delegation

### Treasury Setup

1. Define spending limits
2. Set up multi-signature requirements
3. Configure asset management
4. Implement reporting

## Testing

```bash
# Run unit tests
npm run test

# Run integration tests
npm run test:integration

# Generate coverage report
npm run coverage
```
